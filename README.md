# RCflux
R package for calculating chamber fluxes

The package can be installed directly from a bundled .tar.gz file.
Alternatively, and to keep versions up to date more easily, the package can be installed directly from GitHub, using `install_github` from devtools.

```r
# The install_github function is in the package devtools;
# you'll need to install this if you don't already have it.
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

# warnings becomes errors with install_github by default, and may need to change this with:
Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="true")

# need remotes package for function install_github()
install_github("NERC-CEH/RCflux")
library(RCflux)
# Check version installed
packageVersion("RCflux")

```

And if it installs successfully:

```r
# check the help:
?RCflux
?calcFlux
?convert_GC_output

# files on the S: drive should work as a test
getwd()
setwd("S:/DISE_Instrumentation/GC/Agilent/processing")
convert_GC_output("./filelist_aGCxls.txt")
calcFlux("./filelist.txt")

```
